"""LIVE-tier eval cases — records produced by real ``copilot`` code at gate time.

The fixture tier (``*.jsonl``) grades a pre-baked ``record`` field. That pins the
rubric LOGIC, which is worth having, but it cannot notice when the agent itself
breaks: an auditor disabled PHI scrubbing (``deidentify`` → identity) and made
every answer uncited (``_passed_claims`` → ``[]``) and the fixture tier still
reported 53/53, 100%, exit 0. It was grading a JSON string, not the system.

This module closes that hole. Every case here builds its ``record`` by CALLING
the production code path, in-process, at gate time:

- ``copilot.chat.service.ChatService._answer_inline`` — the real serve-time turn:
  the real ``build_agent`` factory (keyless ⇒ the deterministic ``StubAgent``),
  the real ``copilot.agent.grounding`` extraction, the real
  ``copilot.verification.serve.verify_answer`` deterministic gate, the real
  fail-closed withhold, and the real ``_passed_claims`` claim rebuild.
- ``copilot.rag.deidentify.deidentify`` — the real PHI scrub, called on a
  PHI-bearing probe string; its OUTPUT is what ``no_phi_in_logs`` grades.
- ``copilot.chat.service.ChatReply`` — the real strict reply model, which the
  real ``Claim``/``Citation`` discriminated union validates through.
- ``copilot.rag.retriever.build_retriever(...).retrieve`` — the real guideline
  RAG, run over the real ``agent/corpus/`` ingested by the real
  ``copilot.rag.ingest.ingest_corpus`` into a throwaway SQLite DB. See the
  "known-answer retrieval probe" section below.

So a sabotage of any of those turns this gate RED. That is the whole point.

**Keyless, network-free, deterministic** — the three properties the gate must
keep. The FHIR reader is an in-memory fake (the same structural-protocol trick
``tests/test_verify_answer.py`` uses); the Anthropic key is explicitly cleared
on the Settings copy, so the real ``build_agent`` factory resolves to the
deterministic ``StubAgent`` even if the developer's shell exports a key. The
retrieval probe clears ``voyage_api_key``/``cohere_api_key``/the Langfuse creds
the same way, so ``build_embedder``/``build_reranker``/``build_observability``
resolve to the deterministic ``StubEmbedder``/``StubReranker``/
``NoopObservability`` — real factories, keyless outcome, no network.

Fail-closed by construction: if real code raises while a case is being built,
the case is recorded with an empty envelope, which fails its rubrics and blocks
the gate. A live probe that cannot run is never silently "passing".

# --- the known-answer guideline-RAG retrieval probe -------------------------
#
# Why this exists. Before it, NOTHING in either eval tier imported
# ``copilot.rag.retriever``: an auditor stubbed ``retrieve`` to ``[]``, inverted
# ``rrf_fuse``, no-op'd ``_boost_section_matches`` and replaced ``chunk_body``
# with one garbage chunk — and the gate still reported pass_rate=100.0, exit 0.
# The Week-2 flagship feature was invisible to its own gate, which is exactly
# the hole the LIVE tier was created to close for ``deidentify``/
# ``_passed_claims``. A live guideline RAG defect duly survived: the keyless
# reranker discards the fused sparse+dense ranking outright and serves the wrong
# chunk first.
#
# What it does. Ingests the REAL ``agent/corpus/`` through the REAL
# ``ingest_corpus`` into a throwaway SQLite file, then runs the REAL
# ``GuidelineRetriever.retrieve`` for questions whose answer lives in exactly
# one known section, and grades the SECTION of the top hit.
#
# How it is graded — and why it cannot pass vacuously. Each probe's record
# carries the top hit's REAL ``GuidelineCitation`` (whose ``quote_or_value`` is
# the chunk the retriever actually served) as the claim's citation, and the
# content of the KNOWN-ANSWER section — re-read independently from the ingested
# corpus — as ``source_value``. ``factually_consistent`` then compares "what the
# RAG cited" against "what the correct source actually says", the same
# read-the-truth-back-from-the-source shape ``_source_value`` uses for the FHIR
# claims above. Because each probed section is pinned to exactly ONE chunk (a
# hard setup guard), that comparison holds if and only if the top hit IS the
# expected section's chunk. Retrieval returning nothing, or a corpus that failed
# to ingest, RAISES rather than grading — a probe whose own setup collapsed must
# never report a pass. The corpus itself is never hardcoded here: the expected
# text is whatever the real ingest produced.
#
# Answer-consistency of the top-k below the top hit is deliberately NOT graded:
# these are known-answer *ordering* assertions, and asserting a full ranking
# would bind the gate to incidental ordering of chunks that are all plausibly
# relevant, which is how a probe starts failing for reasons that are not defects.

#: Retrieval depth for the probe — the production ``retrieve`` default.
_RETRIEVAL_TOP_K = 4

#: ``(case_id, question, expected_section)``. Each question has an answer that
#: appears in exactly ONE corpus section, and serving a different section first
#: is a real clinical failure, not a matter of taste:
#:
#: - MAP target in septic shock — "targeting a mean arterial pressure of at
#:   least 65 mmHg" is stated in ``vasopressors-and-map-target`` and nowhere
#:   else. (Sepsis's ``recognition-and-screening`` mentions 65 mmHg only inside
#:   the *definition* of septic shock, never as a resuscitation target.) This is
#:   the canonical probe.
#: - Initial crystalloid volume in sepsis — "30 mL/kg ... within the first three
#:   hours" is only in sepsis ``initial-resuscitation``. The corpus ALSO carries
#:   a different fluid rate for a different condition (DKA ``fluid-therapy``:
#:   "15-20 mL/kg over the first hour"), so a retriever that confuses the two
#:   hands a clinician the wrong drug-free dose for the wrong disease. It is
#:   also a second, independent document-discrimination assertion, so no single
#:   lucky ordering can carry the probe.
#: - Urgent RRT indications — the AEIOU indication list is only in AKI
#:   ``indications-for-renal-replacement``; the ``definition-and-staging``
#:   section name-drops renal replacement therapy but lists no indication.
#:   A third corpus document, and (unlike the first two) one the CURRENT
#:   retriever already ranks correctly — so the probe is demonstrably capable of
#:   both verdicts and is not a case rigged to fail.
